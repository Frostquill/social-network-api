# social-network-api


the following challenge was created in an effort to meet the following criteria:

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list


** Process **

most of the project consisted on using a nosql database system(MongoDB), 3 schemas were created to work in conjunction with each other to allow data storage as well as express and insomnia to provide a visual representation of the information inputed. express was used to allow api access by providing enpoints to access certain pieces of information such as user info and thought info. Overall the project was a success and allowed a back end nosql database to store and retrieve data for a potential front end interface.
